# 🧠 Heuristic Agents

A two-player strategic board game simulation between intelligent agents using **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning** algorithms. This project features custom offensive and defensive heuristics, allowing for dynamic decision-making and performance comparison across search strategies.


## 🎯 Objective

Simulation of a zero-sum game between two AI agents—each using distinct strategies—to analyze how different heuristics and search techniques affect gameplay outcomes.



## 📦 Features

- Turn-based 8x8 board game
- Two types of agents: `minimax` and `alphabeta`
- Offensive and defensive heuristic functions
- Full match simulation with performance stats
- Node tracking and time analysis per move
- Terminal state detection (win by reaching opponent's base or eliminating all opponents)



## 🧠 Algorithms

- **Minimax Search**
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**
- **Custom Heuristics:**
  - Offensive Heuristic
  - Defensive Heuristic
  - Advanced Positional Heuristics
